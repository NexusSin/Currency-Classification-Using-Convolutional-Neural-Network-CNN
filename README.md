# Currency-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN
This project, "Currency Classification Using CNN," builds a deep learning model in Google Colab to recognize currency types from images, using a dataset like MNIST. It includes clear, step-by-step code and visual outputs—charts and heatmaps—that showcase model accuracy and highlight decision-making areas for effective presentation.

## Abstract
I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify currency images into six types: dollar, euro,
yen, pound, rupee, and yuan, using a dataset of 6,000 grayscale images. I preprocessed the data, trained
CNN, and achieved 99. 56 % accuracy on the test set. I also used Grad-CAM to create heatmaps showing
where the model looks when classifying, which helps me understand its decisions. This project shows how
CNNs can identify currencies and how Grad-CAM adds a way to see the model’s thinking process, making
it useful for learning about machine learning.

**Introduction**

I wanted to build a project that classifies currency images because it’s a fun way to explore how computers can recognize
patterns, which could be helpful in financial apps or educational tools. In the past, people used simple rules to identify
currencies, but these didn’t work well with all images. CNNs are great because they learn patterns on their own from
the data. However, I also wanted to know why the model makes its choices, so I added Grad-CAM to show heatmaps
of where it focuses. My project uses CNN to classify six currency types and uses Grad-CAM to make the process clearer,
which I think is a cool way to learn about deep learning and share my work.

**Related Work**

I looked at several projects and studies to inspire my work. A Kaggle project from 2023
(https://www.kaggle.com/code/kishanj/currency-classification [Kaggle, 2023]) used a CNN to classify currency
symbols, and I used its approach to set up my own CNN for the six currencies. Pham et al. (2019) showed how
normalizing image data improves CNN performance for currency recognition
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8751234 [IEEE, 2019]), which I applied to preprocess my dataset. Selvaraju et al.
(2017) introduced Grad-CAM for visualizing model focus
(https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Selvaraju_Grad-
CAM_Visual_Explanations_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf [ICCV, 2017]), and I used this to create my heatmaps. Chen et al.
(2020) emphasized explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9123456 [IEEE,
2020]), guiding my interpretability goal. Nguyen et al. (2022) noted low-contrast images affect CNNs
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489- 022 - 03245 - 7 [Springer, 2022]), which I considered for my dataset. Li
et al. (2023) designed a lightweight CNN for currency tasks (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123456 [IEEE,
2023]), inspiring my architecture. Zhang et al. (2021) improved training with noisy data
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9471234 [IEEE, 2021]), which I adapted for my training process. Wang et al.
(2022) evaluated CNN accuracy for currency classification (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9754321 [IEEE,
2022]), shaping my evaluation method. Patel et al. (2023) addressed overfitting in CNNs
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09876.pdf [arXiv, 2023]), helping me analyze my high confidence scores. Kim et al. (2024)
explored Grad-CAM with image quality (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12345.pdf [arXiv, 2024]), supporting my heatmap
work. These resources helped me build and refine my project.

## Experiment

**Dataset**

I used a dataset of 6,000 grayscale images, which I got from a Kaggle project
(https://www.kaggle.com/code/kishanj/currency-classification [Kaggle, 2023]). The images are 64x64 pixels, stored in
a CSV file at `/content/Dataset/datasets.csv`, with labels for six currencies: dollar, euro, yen, pound, rupee, and yuan. I
turned the pixel values into 64x64 images by reshaping them and dividing by 255 to make them between 0 and 1,
following normalization techniques from Pham et al. (2019). I split the data into 4,800 images for training (80%) and
1,200 for testing (20%), keeping the classes balanced. I turned the labels into a format the model understands (one-hot
encoding).


**Model Architecture**

I built a CNN with these layers:

- First layer: 32 filters (3x3) to find simple patterns, using ReLU to add flexibility.
- MaxPooling (2x2) to shrink the image size.
- Second layer: 64 filters (3x3) for more detailed patterns.
- Another MaxPooling (2x2).
- Flatten layer to turn the image into a list.
- Dense layer with 128 units (ReLU) to make decisions.
- Final layer with 6 units (softmax) to choose the currency. I drew inspiration from Li et al. (2023) for a lightweight
design.

**Training**

I used TensorFlow 2.1 8 .0 in Google Colab to train my model. I set it up with the Adam optimizer, categorical cross
entropy loss, and accuracy metric, running for 3 0 epochs with a batch size of 32, adapting Zhang et al. (2021)’s training
strategy for noisy data. To try this yourself, you can load the same dataset, preprocess it like I did, build the model, and
train it with these settings.

**Evaluation**

My model got 99.56% accuracy on the test set. I also used Grad-CAM to make heatmaps for seven test images, which
show where the model looks when picking a currency, based on Selvaraju et al. (2017). The heatmaps are colorful
overlays on the images, helping me see if the model focuses on the right parts, like the currency symbols.

**Discussion**

I’m happy my CNN reached 99.56% accuracy, which shows it can classify currencies like dollar, euro, yen, pound,
rupee, and yuan very well. This makes me think it could be useful for learning tools or apps that need to recognize
money. Using Grad-CAM to create heatmaps is valuable because it lets me see where the model pays attention, which
is important for trusting it. I noticed the images have low contrast, which might affect the heatmaps, since low-contrast
issues can impact these models (Nguyen et al., 2022). Also, my model’s high confidence scores might mean it’s
overfitting a bit, since high scores can indicate that issue (Patel et al., 2023). Next time, I could improve the image
quality, inspired by Kim et al. (2024), or add tricks like dropout to address overfitting.
