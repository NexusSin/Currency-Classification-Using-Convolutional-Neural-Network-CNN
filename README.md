# Currency-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
This project, "Currency Classification Using CNN," builds a deep learning model in Google Colab to recognize currency types from images, using a dataset like MNIST. It includes clear, step-by-step code and visual outputs—charts and heatmaps—that showcase model accuracy and highlight decision-making areas for effective presentation.
